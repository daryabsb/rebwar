Hip:
Osteoarthritis of the hip: Degenerative wear and tear of the hip joint cartilage, causing pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility.

Hip fractures: Breaks in the bones of the hip, often resulting from falls or osteoporosis, leading to severe pain and immobility.

Bursitis of the hip: Inflammation of the bursae, small fluid-filled sacs, around the hip joint, causing pain and tenderness.

Hip impingement syndrome: Abnormal contact between the bones of the hip joint, leading to pain, stiffness, and restricted movement.

Hip labral tears: Damage to the cartilage (labrum) lining the hip socket, causing pain, clicking, or locking sensations in the hip joint.

Avascular necrosis of the hip: Death of bone tissue due to poor blood supply, leading to pain and eventual collapse of the hip joint.

Hip dysplasia: Abnormal development of the hip joint, resulting in instability, pain, and increased risk of osteoarthritis.

Trochanteric bursitis: Inflammation of the bursae located near the greater trochanter of the hip, causing pain and tenderness on the outer hip.

Knee:

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear: Injury to the ACL, causing knee instability, swelling, and difficulty in bearing weight.

Meniscal tears: Tears in the cartilage (meniscus) of the knee, leading to pain, swelling, and sometimes locking of the joint.

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (runner's knee): Pain around the kneecap, aggravated by activities like running or climbing stairs.

Osteoarthritis of the knee: Degenerative joint disease-causing pain, stiffness, and swelling in the knee joint.

Knee bursitis (prepatellar or pes anserine): Inflammation of the bursae around the knee, resulting in pain and swelling.
Patellar tendonitis (jumper's knee): Inflammation of the tendon connecting the kneecap to the shinbone, causing pain below the kneecap.

Iliotibial (IT) band syndrome: Inflammation of the iliotibial band, causing pain on the outer side of the knee, especially during running or cycling.

--Knee dislocation: Displacement of the bones in the knee joint, causing severe pain, instability, and possible nerve or blood vessel damage.

Hand and Wrist:

Carpal tunnel syndrome: Compression of the median nerve in the wrist, leading to numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand.

Trigger finger/thumb: Condition causing fingers to catch or lock in a bent position, often accompanied by pain and clicking.

De Quervain's tenosynovitis: Inflammation of the tendons at the base of the thumb, causing pain and swelling in the wrist.

Ganglion cysts: Noncancerous lumps filled with fluid, commonly occurring on the back of the hand or wrist.

Wrist sprains: Injuries to the ligaments of the wrist, resulting in pain, swelling, and reduced range of motion.

Hand fractures (e.g., metacarpal fractures): Breaks in the bones of the hand, causing pain, swelling, and deformity.

Dupuytren's contracture: Thickening and tightening of the tissue beneath the skin of the palm, leading to finger contractures.

--Rheumatoid arthritis of the hand/wrist: Chronic autoimmune disease-causing joint inflammation, pain, and deformities in the hands and wrists.

Shoulder and Elbow:

Rotator cuff tears: Tears in the muscles and tendons of the rotator cuff, causing pain and weakness in the shoulder.

Shoulder impingement syndrome: Pinching of the tendons and bursa in the shoulder, resulting in pain and restricted movement.

Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis): Stiffness and pain in the shoulder joint, limiting mobility and causing discomfort.

Shoulder dislocation: Displacement of the upper arm bone (humerus) from the shoulder socket, causing severe pain and instability.

Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis): Pain and inflammation of the tendons on the outside of the elbow, often due to repetitive motion.

Golfer's elbow (medial epicondylitis): Pain and inflammation of the tendons on the inside of the elbow, commonly caused by overuse.

Biceps tendonitis: Inflammation of the biceps tendon, resulting in pain in the front of the shoulder or elbow.

--Shoulder instability: Condition where the shoulder joint is prone to dislocation or subluxation, leading to recurrent episodes of instability and pain.

Foot and Ankle:

Plantar fasciitis: Inflammation of the plantar fascia, causing heel pain, especially with the first steps in the morning.

Ankle sprains: Injuries to the ligaments surrounding the ankle joint, resulting in pain, swelling, and instability.

Achilles tendonitis: Inflammation of the Achilles tendon, causing pain and stiffness in the back of the ankle.

Bunions (hallux valgus): Bony bumps that form at the base of the big toe, causing pain and deformity.

Morton's neuroma: Thickening of the tissue around a nerve between the toes, leading to pain, burning, or numbness.

Plantar warts: Viral infections causing small, painful growths on the sole of the foot.

Tarsal tunnel syndrome: Compression of the tibial nerve as it passes through the tarsal tunnel, resulting in pain, tingling, or numbness in the foot.

--High arches (pes cavus): Condition where the arch of the foot is abnormally raised, leading to foot pain, instability, and difficulty fitting into shoes.

Spine:

Herniated disc (slipped or bulging disc): Rupture or protrusion of the intervertebral disc, causing nerve compression and pain.

Spinal stenosis: Narrowing of the spinal canal, leading to pressure on the spinal cord or nerves, resulting in pain and weakness.

Degenerative disc disease: Wear and tear of the spinal discs, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility.

Spondylolisthesis: Forward displacement of a vertebra, causing instability and potential nerve compression.

Sciatica: Pain, numbness, or tingling radiating along the sciatic nerve, often caused by compression or irritation.

Spinal fractures (compression fractures): Breaks in the vertebrae, commonly due to osteoporosis or trauma, causing pain and potential spinal cord compression.

Scoliosis: Abnormal curvature of the spine, causing sideways curvature and potential pain or deformity.

--Facet joint syndrome: Degeneration or inflammation of the facet joints in the spine, resulting in back pain and stiffness.
