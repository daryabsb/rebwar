1.	Hand & Wrist Surgery
The hand and wrist consist of numerous bones, tendons, and ligaments allowing for intricate movements. Conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, and fractures are common. Carpal tunnel syndrome causes numbness and tingling due to pressure on the median nerve. Tendonitis results from overuse, leading to pain and swelling. Fractures can occur from trauma, causing pain and difficulty moving. Treatment involves splinting, therapy, medication, or surgery, depending on the severity.

CONDITIONS:
-	Carpal tunnel syndrome
-	Trigger finger/thumb.
-	De Quatrainâ€™s tenosynovitis
-	Ganglion cysts
-	Wrist sprains
-	Hand fractures (e.g., metacarpal fractures)
-	Dupuytren's contracture
-	Rheumatoid arthritis of the hand/wrist
PROCEDURES:
1.	Carpal Tunnel Release: A surgical procedure to relieve pressure on the median nerve in the wrist by cutting the transverse carpal ligament. This procedure alleviates symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, such as numbness and tingling in the hand and fingers.
2.	Trigger Finger Release: Surgical correction of trigger finger, a condition where a finger gets stuck in a bent position due to inflammation or thickening of the flexor tendon sheath. The surgeon releases the tight portion of the sheath to allow smooth finger movement.
3.	Dupuytren's Contracture Release:  Surgery to correct Dupuytren's contracture, a condition where thickened tissue in the palm forms into tight cords, causing fingers to bend inward. The surgeon removes or divides these cords to restore finger mobility.
4.	Wrist Arthroscopy: A minimally invasive procedure using a small camera and surgical instruments to diagnose and treat various wrist conditions, such as ligament injuries, cartilage damage, or wrist fractures.

2.	Foot & Ankle Surgery
The foot and ankle support body weight and facilitate movement, making them susceptible to injuries and conditions. Common problems include plantar fasciitis, ankle sprains, and Achilles tendonitis. Plantar fasciitis causes heel pain due to inflammation of the plantar fascia. Ankle sprains result from twisting, causing pain and swelling. Achilles tendonitis involves pain and stiffness in the Achilles tendon, often due to overuse. Treatments range from rest and ice to physical therapy or surgery, depending on the severity.

CONDITIONS:
-	Plantar fasciitis
-	Ankle sprains
-	Achilles tendonitis
-	Bunions (hallux valgus)
-	Morton's neuroma
-	Plantar warts
-	Tarsal tunnel syndrome
-	High arches (pes cavus)
PROCEDURES:
1.	Ankle Fusion (Arthrodesis): Surgical fusion of the ankle joint to treat severe arthritis or instability. The surgeon removes damaged cartilage and then fuses the bones together using screws, plates, or bone grafts.
2.	Achilles Tendon Repair: Surgical repair of a ruptured Achilles tendon, typically performed by suturing the torn ends back together or using grafts to reinforce the repair.
3.	Bunionectomy: Surgical removal of a bunion, a bony bump that forms at the base of the big toe. The surgeon realigns the bones and soft tissues to relieve pain and improve foot function.
4.	Ankle Ligament Reconstruction: Surgery to repair or reconstruct damaged ligaments in the ankle, commonly performed for chronic ankle instability or recurrent ankle sprains. The surgeon may use tissue grafts or synthetic materials to strengthen the ligaments.

3.	Hip Surgery
The hip is a ball-and-socket joint that connects your thigh bone (femur) to your pelvis. Common hip issues include arthritis, bursitis, and fractures. Arthritis can cause pain and stiffness, while bursitis results in inflammation and tenderness. Fractures are breaks in the hip bone, often due to falls or osteoporosis. Treatments range from medications and physical therapy to surgery, depending on the severity of the condition.

CONDITIONS:
-	Osteoarthritis of the hip
-	Hip fractures.
-	Bursitis of the hip
-	Hip impingement syndrome.
-	Hip labral tears.
-	Avascular necrosis of the hip
-	Hip dysplasia.
-	Trochanteric bursitis
PROCEDURES:
1.	Total Hip Replacement (THR): THR involves removing damaged bone and cartilage from the hip joint and replacing it with artificial components made of metal, ceramic, or plastic. This procedure aims to relieve pain and improve function in patients with severe hip arthritis or fractures.
2.	Hip Arthroscopy: A minimally invasive procedure where a small camera and surgical instruments are inserted through small incisions around the hip joint. It's used to diagnose and treat various hip conditions such as labral tears, hip impingement, and loose cartilage.
3.	Hip Resurfacing: Like THR, but instead of removing the entire head of the femur, only the damaged surface is removed and capped with a metal prosthesis. This preserves more bone and is often recommended for younger, active patients with hip arthritis.
4.	Hip Fracture Repair: Surgery to stabilize a fractured hip, typically using metal screws, plates, or rods to hold the broken bones in place. This procedure aims to restore stability and function to the hip joint, allowing for proper healing and rehabilitation.

4.	Knee Surgery
The knee is a complex joint crucial for walking, running, and jumping. Common knee problems include arthritis, ligament tears (like the ACL or MCL), and meniscus tears. Arthritis leads to pain, swelling, and stiffness, while ligament tears cause instability and difficulty moving. Meniscus tears result in pain and locking sensations. Treatment options include rest, physical therapy, injections, or surgery, depending on the injury's extent.

CONDITIONS:
-	Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear
-	Meniscal tears
-	Patellofemoral pain syndrome (runner's knee)
-	Osteoarthritis of the knee
-	Knee bursitis (prepatellar or pes anserine)
-	Patellar tendonitis (jumper's knee)
-	Iliotibial (IT) band syndrome
-	Knee dislocation
PROCEDURES:
1.	Total Knee Replacement (TKR): TKR involves removing damaged cartilage and bone from the knee joint and replacing it with artificial components made of metal and plastic. This procedure is performed to alleviate pain and improve mobility in patients with severe knee arthritis or injuries.
2.	Knee Arthroscopy: A minimally invasive procedure where a small camera and surgical instruments are inserted through small incisions around the knee joint. It's used to diagnose and treat various knee conditions such as torn cartilage (meniscus), ligament injuries, and loose bodies.
3.	ACL Reconstruction: Surgery to replace a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the knee with a tendon graft from another part of the body or a donor. This procedure aims to restore stability and function to the knee joint, particularly in athletes or active individuals.
4.	Meniscus Repair: Surgical repair of a torn meniscus (cartilage) in the knee, typically performed using small incisions and specialized instruments. The torn edges of the meniscus are sutured together or anchored back to the bone to promote healing and preserve knee function.

5.	Shoulder & Elbow Surgery
The shoulder and elbow joints enable a wide range of motion but are prone to various issues. Common conditions include rotator cuff tears, tennis elbow, and shoulder impingement. Rotator cuff tears cause pain and weakness, affecting arm movement. Tennis elbow results from overuse, leading to pain and tenderness around the elbow. Shoulder impingement causes pain when raising the arm due to tendon inflammation. Treatment may include rest, physical therapy, injections, or surgery, depending on the condition's severity.

CONDITIONS:
-	Rotator cuff tears
-	Shoulder impingement syndrome
-	Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis)
-	Shoulder dislocation
-	Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis)
-	Golfer's elbow (medial epicondylitis)
-	Biceps tendonitis
-	Shoulder instability
PROCEDURES:
1.	Rotator Cuff Repair: Surgical repair of a torn rotator cuff tendon in the shoulder. The surgeon reattaches the torn tendon to the bone using sutures or anchors to restore strength and function.
2.	Shoulder Arthroscopy: A minimally invasive procedure using a small camera and surgical instruments to diagnose and treat various shoulder conditions, such as rotator cuff tears, labral tears, or shoulder impingement.
3.	Tommy John Surgery (Ulnar Collateral Ligament Reconstruction): Reconstruction of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in the elbow, commonly performed in athletes to repair ligament injuries, particularly in baseball pitchers.
4.	Elbow Arthroscopy: A minimally invasive procedure using a small camera and surgical instruments to diagnose and treat various elbow conditions, such as loose bodies, arthritis, or tennis elbow.

6.	Spine Surgery
The spine is the backbone of the body, consisting of vertebrae, discs, and nerves. Common spinal conditions include herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and sciatica. Herniated discs occur when the soft inner material protrudes through the tough outer layer, causing pain and nerve compression. Spinal stenosis is the narrowing of the spinal canal, leading to pressure on the spinal cord or nerves, resulting in pain and weakness. Sciatica is caused by compression of the sciatic nerve, leading to pain, numbness, and tingling down the leg. Treatment options include medication, physical therapy, injections, or surgery, depending on the severity and location of the issue.

CONDITIONS:
-	Herniated disc (slipped or bulging disc)
-	Spinal stenosis
-	Degenerative disc disease
-	Spondylolisthesis
-	Sciatica
-	Spinal fractures (compression fractures)
-	Scoliosis
-	Facet joint syndrome.
PROCEDURES:
1.	Laminectomy: Surgical removal of the lamina (back part of the vertebra) to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerves caused by conditions like spinal stenosis or herniated discs.
2.	Spinal Fusion: Surgery to join two or more vertebrae together using bone grafts, screws, and rods. It's done to stabilize the spine and relieve pain caused by conditions like degenerative disc disease or spinal fractures.
3.	Discectomy: Surgical removal of a herniated or damaged portion of a spinal disc to relieve pressure on the adjacent nerves, commonly performed for conditions like sciatica or radiculopathy.
4.	Vertebroplasty/Kyphoplasty: Procedures to stabilize vertebral compression fractures by injecting bone cement into the fractured vertebrae. This helps to relieve pain and restore vertebral height and stability.
